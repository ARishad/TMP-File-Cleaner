# Temporary Files Cleaner
For Windows OS only!

- A simple small program for Windows Operating Systems that cleans all the junk/temporary files/temporary folders from Windows OS! In time, if not cleaned by a specific time basis, this folder tend to really increase its size resulting in a massive **HDD / SSD** space usage just by keeping unwanted junk files!

- The Temp folder location is in --> **C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp** that can be accessed by advanced users typing "**%temp%**" or "**%appdata%**" into Windows Search Bar.

- AFAIK the know programs for cleaning such as CCLeaner, ATF Cleaner, BitBleach etc does not have the option to clean the Temp folder for some reason. With this program you can, it is actually very handy hence I use it on daily basis!

- What people usualy do, is to manually go to this specific folder and manually delete all the junk files. Well this program was created to ease that work with a few simple clicks.

- I would recommend running it as **Administrator**

## ATTENTION !
- No it's not a virus, but if your Anti Virus somehow detects this program as a potential threat, you have to understand that this program is deleting files from Windows Temp folder, so you might want to add it to whitelist... Duh. :3

- NOT all of the files will be deleted! Some of them might be used in the current process or simply can't be deleted. It happens do not worry.

## What does this program do really?
- Clears all the junk/temporary files/temporary folders
- Shows how much space you freed.
- Easy to use
- Is not going to harm your computer by any means.
