# Temporary Files Cleaner
For Windows OS only!

- A simple small program for Windows Operating Systems that cleans all the junk/temporary files/temporary folders from Windows OS! In time, if not cleaned by a specific time basis, this folder tend to really increase its size resulting in a massive **HDD / SSD** space usage just by keeping unwanted junk files!

- The Temp folder location is in --> **C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp** that can be accessed by advanced users typing "**%temp%**" or "**%appdata%**" into Windows Search Bar.

- What people usualy do, is to manually go to this specific folder and manually delete all the junk files. Well this program was created to ease that work with a few simple clicks.

## ATTENTION !
- No it's not a virus, but if your Anti Virus somehow detects this program as a potential threat, you have to understand that this program is deleting files from Windows Temp folder, so you might want to add it to whitelist... Duh. :3
